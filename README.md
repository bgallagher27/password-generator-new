# Better-Password-Generator

# Description:
The Better Password Generator allows the user to create a secure password through the command line by answering a few short questions. The user is asked how long they would like their generated password to be, then presented with options for the types of characters used in the generated password. Then the user is provided with a randomly generated password based on their inputs.
